Implementation of quick sort with the pivot element being the first element.
The pivot element moved to its place by findding the count of the elements smaller than the element.
Then all smaller elements are moved to the left of pivot element and larger element are moved to right of the pivot element.
Then the quick sort function is called recursively on the other two parts.
